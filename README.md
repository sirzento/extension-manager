# Blueprint Extension Manager
Easily install or remove your extensions directly from the panel.

## Getting started
Just configure the SSH user you want to use for managing extension that will run the Blueprint commands via the settings button on the top left.

## How does it work?
The Extension Manager will open a local SSH connection to securely run Blueprint commands to install or remove extensions. The password will never be saved!
